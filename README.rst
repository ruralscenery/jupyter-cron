Jupyter cron
============

Simple clock/cron process that monitors a specific directory and run jobs based on its filename.

Currently filename with this pattern is supported:

(every X at time) where

**X** is ['day', 'monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday', 'saturday', 'sunday']

**time** is either in short form without minutes like 5PM or long form with minutes, 5.00PM


For example:

**notebooks/generate_model (every day at 5pm).ipynb**  will trigger `jupyter nbconvert` to run every day at 5pm.

**scripts/gen (every monday at 12pm).py** will trigger `python scripts/gen....py` to run.
